# Notes

These are notes written in LaTeX for (mostly CS) courses taken at University of Waterloo, Lund University, and now McGill University. 
They are not meant to be replacement for lecture notes or textbooks but rather concise and well-structured notes on the material that will refresh the knowledge or explicitly lay out key points
