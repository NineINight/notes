# Notes
Notes written in LaTeX for the CS/SE courses I've taken

They are not meant to be replacement for lectures/lecture notes/textbooks but rather concise and well-structured key points, my ideal version of a cheat sheet. For some courses, I found the professor's notes to be great and I've linked those below.
